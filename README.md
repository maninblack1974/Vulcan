# Project 3 - Vulcan
An issue facing many Small Businesses' today is finding reliable and speciality Service Providers to meet there needs. After talking with several owners in the food industry we found this to be a big issue. In order to meet this need we decided to work on our application, Vulcan. The idea behind Vilcan is to all business owners to find reliable Service Providers in their area to meet their needs. Whether it be Hood Cleaning, Electrical, Cleaning, or Distribution businesses need a place they can go to find reliable providers.
